# CAiSE-20 paper: Mining User Opinions To Support Requirement Engineering: An Empirical Study

The repository contains our manually annotated dataset and the annotation guidline. These artifcats are parts of a submission for CAiSE'20. In the paper, section 4.2 describes how we created the annotated dataset to answer our research questions.

Do, not duplicate it or distribute without authors' permission. 

We hope our novel annotated dataset and an evaluation method described in the paper will contribute to improving the quality of app review mining techniques.
